## 1. Game Selection & Scope (Sprint 0)

### 1.1 Game Overview

* **Chosen Game:** CommandFleet (Battleship-style naval strategy game)
* **Player Capacity:** 2 Players (Simulated via 2 CML Client nodes)
* **Game Summary:** CommandFleet is a two-player, turn-based command-line naval strategy game. Each player has a 10x10 grid containing a fleet of five ships. At the beginning of the game, each player's ships will be placed randomly on their board without overlapping or extending beyond the grid. Players will then alternate turns selecting coordinates to attack on the opponent's board. The server will maintain the game state, determine whether each attack is a hit or miss, and notify players when a ship has been sunk. The game continues until one player has successfully sunk the opponent's entire fleet.

### 1.2 Core Game Rules & Win/Draw Conditions

* **Turn Mechanics:** Once two players have connected and their fleets have been generated, the server will select the starting player. Players will alternate turns and may make one attack per turn by entering a coordinate on the opponent's grid. The server will validate each attack and reject invalid coordinates or coordinates that have already been attacked. An invalid attack does not cause the player to lose their turn.

* **Victory Condition:** A player wins when they have successfully hit every grid position occupied by the opposing player's ships, sinking the opponent's entire fleet. Once this occurs, the server will notify both players of the winner and end the game.

* **Draw/Tie Condition:** CommandFleet does not have a normal draw condition because players attack sequentially and the game ends immediately when one player's entire fleet has been sunk. If the game ends prematurely because of a connection failure or player disconnection, the game will be considered incomplete rather than a draw.

## 2. Application-Layer Messaging Protocol Blueprint (Sprint 1 Deliverable)

### 2.1 Message Transport & Serialization Format
- **Transport Protocol:** TCP
- **Serialization Format:** [JSON / Fixed-Header Binary / Delimited Text]
- **Framing Mechanism:** [e.g., Newline-delimited (`\n`) JSON payloads OR 4-byte big-endian length prefix]

### 2.2 Message Schema Definitions

#### Message Types:
1. `CONNECT` (Client -> Server): Request to join the game room.
2. `LOBBY_WAIT` (Server -> Client): Notification that server is waiting for Player 2.
3. `GAME_START` (Server -> Clients): Game initiated, assigns roles (e.g. Player X vs Player O).
4. `MOVE` (Client -> Server): Player action (e.g., cell coordinates or answer choice).
5. `STATE_UPDATE` (Server -> Clients): Broadcast current game board / state and active player turn.
6. `GAME_OVER` (Server -> Clients): Victory / Draw notification with final scores.
7. `ERROR` (Server -> Client): Invalid move or malformed packet error.

#### Example JSON Protocol Schema:
```json
{
  "msg_type": "MOVE",
  "player_id": "Player_1",
  "payload": {
    "row": 0,
    "col": 2
  },
  "timestamp": 1727000000
}
```

### 2.3 Game State Machine (FSM) Design (Sprint 1 Deliverable)
- **State Transitions:** Detail state flow: `INIT` -> `WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS` -> `PLAYER_TURN` -> `EVALUATE_MOVE` -> `CHECK_WIN_DRAW` -> `GAME_OVER` -> `CLEANUP`.

---

## 3. Game Behavior & Server Concurrency Architecture (Sprint 2 Deliverable)

### 3.1 Server Concurrency Strategy
- **Architecture Choice:** [Multi-Threading (`threading.Thread`) OR Non-blocking I/O multiplexing (`select.select` / `selectors`)]
- **Synchronization Logic:** Explain how shared game state and client list are thread-safe (e.g. `threading.Lock`) to prevent race conditions during turn processing.

### 3.2 State & Score Synchronization Across Clients
- **Turn Enforcement:** Detail how the server validates active player ID before processing moves and broadcasts updated turn notifications to all clients.
- **Score & Board Synchronization:** Describe how state broadcasts keep client screens synchronized in real time.

---

## 4. Coding & AI Implementation Plan (Sprint 3)

- **Permitted AI Tools:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude]
- **AI Prompting & Constraint Strategy:** Explain how you will constrain AI models to generate code (in Python or your chosen language) that adheres strictly to the protocol blueprint and FSM designed in Sprints 1 & 2.
- **Implementation Risk Management:** Detail your plan to leverage past programming experience and manage time to ensure code completion on schedule.

## 5. CML Multi-Subnet Topology & Wireshark Deployment Plan (Sprint 4 & 5 Deliverable)

> For now you can use the topology below. We may update this when we get to defining subnets.

### 5.1 Subnet & Router Design
- **Subnet A (Client 1):** `192.168.10.0/24` (Interface `Gi0/1` on Router R1)
- **Subnet B (Client 2):** `192.168.11.0/24` (Interface `Gi0/2` on Router R1)
- **Subnet C (Game Server):** `192.168.20.0/24` (Interface `Gi0/1` on Router R2)
- **Router Backbone:** `10.0.0.0/30` (Interface `Gi0/0` on R1 <-> `Gi0/0` on R2)

### 5.2 DHCP Pools & DNS Configuration Plan
- **Router R1 DHCP Pool 1 (`CLIENT1_POOL`):** Leases `192.168.10.10` - `192.168.10.50`, gateway `192.168.10.1`, DNS `10.0.0.2`.
- **Router R1 DHCP Pool 2 (`CLIENT2_POOL`):** Leases `192.168.11.10` - `192.168.11.50`, gateway `192.168.11.1`, DNS `10.0.0.2`.
- **Router R2 Authoritative DNS:** Configured with `ip dns server` and static host mapping `server.[yourlastname].edu` -> `192.168.20.100`.

### 5.3 Deployment Strategy & Wireshark Trace Capture
- **CML Deployment Strategy:** Deploy `server.py` onto Subnet C node (`192.168.20.100`) behind Router R2, and `client.py` onto Subnet A and Subnet B nodes behind Router R1.
- **Cisco Infrastructure Configuration:** Router R1 DHCP pools (`CLIENT1_POOL`, `CLIENT2_POOL`) and Router R2 authoritative DNS (`ip host server.[lastname].edu 192.168.20.100`).
- **Wireshark Trace Capture Plan:** Capture DHCP DORA exchange (`dhcp_negotiation.pcap`) and DNS query/response resolution (`dns_lookup.pcap`).
